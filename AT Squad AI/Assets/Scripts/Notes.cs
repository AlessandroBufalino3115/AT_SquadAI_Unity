 * 
 * thigns left to do     tell the enemy to attack this specifc enemy
 * 
 * do the sorting array for the sphercast   
        var orderedByProximity = colliders.OrderBy(c => (this.transform.position - c.transform.position).sqrMagnitude).ToArray();
 * this porb used everywhere
 * 
 * need some sort of context thing, when an enemy is surrounded by more than or = to 2 say something
 * maybe one is getting low on health
 * 
 * 
 * the middle thing for the flag i am pretty sure its blocking some raycasts
 * 
 * when the thing goes back into cover shoot another ray cast to see if the pos in its current form can be shot at 
 * 
 * the look
 * 
 * main menu
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * actual things left not much just the look, there are some issue with the raycasts and some enemies thant dont get detected but overall i think its fine how it is
 * does need a menu and some explanations
 * 
 * when there are enemnis in the middle lose, increase the enemies coming to you 
 * when the friendly die finish game
